# StudyOrDie

Have you ever felt like you really needed to get an essay done, but you just keep getting distracted by other things?
Feel like the conventional methods of focusing just aren't enough?

Just download the extension, go to google docs and start work.... or prepare to be punished. 
StudyOrDie analyzes your activity in google docs (like your key-presses), and makes sure that you are getting a bare minimum amount of work done. If not, you'll be punished. Severely. 

-As a general overview, our extension makes sure you type a minimum number of keypresses in a google doc every few seconds, and if you don't type enough characters, one of two things will happen:

1 - You will be redirected to a jump scare. TURN THE VOLUME DOWN
2 - Chrome will attempt to get into your facebook messages and send 'embarassing' messages to your friends. 

^The point is that these two consequences of not working are 'bad enough' so that you will be forced to continue working
