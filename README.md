# StudyOrDie

Have you ever felt like you really needed to get an essay done, but you just keep getting distracted by other things?
Feel like the conventional methods of focusing just aren't enough?

Just download the extension, go to google docs and start work.... or prepare to be punished. 
StudyOrDie analyzes your activity in google docs (like your key-presses), and makes sure that you are getting a bare minimum amount of work done. If not, you'll be punished. Severely.
